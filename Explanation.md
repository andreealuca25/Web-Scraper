Introduction:

I chose Node.js and Puppeteer for flexibility and ease of use, simplifying my entry into web scraping. My scraper is versatile, extracting text, links, and images from web pages to meet diverse needs. Ensuring data quality, I implemented URL validation to process only valid website URLs. I designed an intuitive interface that converts JSON data into a user-friendly table format.

Features:

-User input validation ensures reliability and user-friendliness.
-I prioritized user experience by presenting the JSON data in an intuitive table format.
-I added a download JSON function and a function for viewing images in another tab.

Learning Experience:

-Using Puppeteer made the data extraction easier to understand.
-Integrating Vue.js and Express.js deepened my full-stack development and API design knowledge.
-Managing diverse data types honed my data manipulation skills with real-world data.
-Prioritizing user experience ensured accessibility for all users.

Conclusion:

I enjoyed creating this web scraper as it provided me with a valuable opportunity to deepen my knowledge in full-stack development and web scraping. Additionally, working with Vue.js, a technology I had never used before, proved to be a challenging yet ultimately rewarding experience.
